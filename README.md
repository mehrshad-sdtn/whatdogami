# Dog-Breed-Classifier
A Deep Learning model for dog breed classification using Transfer Learning
[Stanford dog dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) was used for this project with <br>
[Xception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357) CNN architecture, Xception pre-trained weights were used, and the final layer (FC) was trained

#### Xception Architecture
